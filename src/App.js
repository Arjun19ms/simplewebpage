                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
                        HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
                        A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
                        This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.
                        Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

                            Machine Learning is the field of study 
                            that gives computers the capability to 
                            learn without being explicitly 
                            programmed. ML is one of the most exciting
                            technologies that one would have ever 
                            come across. As it is evident from the 
                            name, it gives the computer that makes 
                            it more similar to humans: The ability 
                            to learn. Machine learning is actively 
                            being used today, perhaps in many more 
                            places than one would expect.
